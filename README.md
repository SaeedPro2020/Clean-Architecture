## Features

#### • Clean Architecture: The project follows the Clean Architecture principles, separating the application into layers (presentation, domain, and data) to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability.
#### • Retrofit: Retrofit is used as the HTTP client library for making network requests and handling API communication.
#### • Coroutines: Kotlin coroutines are employed for handling asynchronous tasks in a concise and efficient manner, providing smooth and responsive user experience.
#### • Room: Room, an Android SQLite object mapping library, is utilized for local data storage, providing an abstraction layer over the SQLite database.
#### • Data Binding: Android Data Binding is used to bind UI components to data sources, reducing boilerplate code and enhancing code readability.
#### • Moshi: Moshi is employed for JSON serialization and deserialization, simplifying the parsing of JSON data received from API responses.
#### • WorkerThread: WorkerThread (part of Android Jetpack) is used for performing background tasks, such as database operations or API calls, efficiently and reliably.
